# Meeting-Minutes

This is a repo for slides from our main meetings

This repo was started to contain the minutes from our new Monthly Meeting cycle beginning November 2022. It is intended to help capture the discussions around the editing process for the next generation of the OpenChain license compliance and security assurance standards.
